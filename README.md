# STACK-BASED-ALU

In this project we implemented a stack based alu which can performs addition and multiplication operations on the top two elements of the stack.


## Tools
In this section, you should mention the hardware or simulators utilized in your project.
- VS-code
- ModelSim


## Implementation Details

At the first we have to implemented a stack based alu which said in the question and after that write a test bench for it to make sure it works properly. <br>
After that we have to implemented a module which get an mathematical expression and convert it into a postfix expression and calculate the result with stack based alu
and I wrote a test bench for it to make sure it works properly. <br>
More details on how to implement are available in the documentation.

## How to Run

We have to compile our code with ModelSim and simulation them. <br>
Its inputs and outputs are analyzed in the documentaion.
But you can See an example below.
## Input

I just push some number in the stack and pop them to see that numbers are saved in stack properly
## Output

As you can see the stack stores numbers properly.

You can refer to the documentation to see all the test benchs.
